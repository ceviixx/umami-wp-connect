## Code Style

### PHP
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards
- Use tabs for indentation (WordPress convention)
- Run PHPCS locally: `phpcs --standard=WordPress .` (see `.github/workflows/lint.yml` for inline config)
- PHPCS errors are blocking; warnings are advisory

### JavaScript
- Follow WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards
- Declare `wp` as a global when using WordPress APIs
- Use ESLint (see inline config in `.github/workflows/lint.yml`)

### General
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

- `chore: update dependencies`
- `docs: improve README installation steps`
- `refactor: simplify render_block filter`
- `test: add workflow for structure check`

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Target branch:** `main`
- **Title:** Use conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: add consent gate option`)
- **Description:**
  - What changed and why
  - Related issues (e.g., `Closes #42`)
  - Screenshots or GIFs if UI-related
  - Breaking changes (if any)
- **Keep PRs focused:** one feature or fix per PR
- **CI checks:** All GitHub Actions workflows (Lint, Security, Syntax, Structure) must pass before merge
- **Respond to reviews:** address feedback promptly
