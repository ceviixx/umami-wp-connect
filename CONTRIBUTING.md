# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!

## General Rules

- **Always work on your own branch** (e.g. `feature/xyz`, `bugfix/abc`).
- **Open pull requests (PRs) only against the `dev` branch**, never directly against `main`.
- The `main` branch is protected and only receives merges from `dev`.
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Follow the project's coding style.
- Add tests and documentation if necessary.
- Describe what you changed and why in your PR description.
- Respond to review comments in a timely manner.

## Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository (optional if you do not have write access).
2. Create a new branch from `dev`.
3. Implement your changes.
4. Test your changes locally.
5. Open a pull request targeting `dev`.
6. Wait for review and feedback.
7. After approval, your PR will be merged.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and friendly to all contributors.
